# 7KPP Character Builder
A character builder for the visual novel [Seven Kingdoms: The Princess Problem](https://azalynestudios.itch.io/seven-kingdoms-the-princess-problem) (aka 7KPP). To take out the stress of checking over numbers over and over again because of how much stats affect the game and the outcomes available, I created this simple one-page character builder.

This is built for users who have already played the game, know what the character choices reference, and for the mid-maxers who want specific outcomes.

## Main Features
1. Instantaneous Results - See both cumulative and overall skills change with each option checked. View them in a range/slider scale for easier reability.
2. Background Compatibility - Also see how the unlocked backgrounds and their skill boosts affect the build 
3. NG+ Boosts - Choose whether or not use the NG+ stat boosts (I based this off the routes I've done, and I'm 95% sure I did all of them)
